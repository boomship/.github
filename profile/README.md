# Boomship

Building the future through human–AI collaboration.

## Our Philosophy

Every repository in the Boomship organization is **architected by humans** and **implemented entirely by AI**. 🐙

This is not outsourcing. It's orchestration.
We design, they build — together.

## What We Build

Modular, forward-thinking software engineered to explore the full potential of AI-assisted development.  
From infrastructure to interfaces, every repo pushes the limits of what's possible when human intent meets machine execution.
